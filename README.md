# Python-program
## Day 1
Day 1 include two parts of codes    
*1st,The code to convert inch to cm, and cm to inch*
```
value = float(input('Please enter the length:'))
unit  = input('Please enter the unit:')

if unit == 'inch':
    output = 2.54 * value
    # %f means the result is float
    # %.3f means the result is float and have 3 trims
    print('%.3finches = %.3fcm' % (value, output) )

elif unit == 'cm':
    output = value / 2.54
    print('%.3fcm = %.3finches' % (value, output ))
# if end with esle, there should have no condition
else:
    print('Please enter the unit, inch or cm')
```

*2nd, The code to caculate couse grade in LSE*

```
def course_grade_caculation( times , homework_per, fina_per,course_code):
    '''
    The inputs are the total times of the homework, the percent of the homeworkgrades,
    the percent of final projecs and the course_code
    the output is the final grades you get
    '''
    homework_grades = 0
    for i in range(1, times + 1):
        a = float(input('Please enter the grade of your ' +str(i)+ ' homework:'))
        homework_grades += a

    homework_grades = homework_grades * homework_per
    print('Your homework grade is :' + str(homework_grades))

    finalpro_grades = float(input('Please enter the grade of your final project:'))
    final_grades  = homework_grades + finalpro_grades * fina_per
    # accordding to the grade to decide the grade level
    if final_grades >= 70:
        level = 'Distinction'
    elif final_grades < 70 and final_grades >= 60:
        level = 'Merit'
    elif final_grades < 60 and final_grades >= 50:
        level = 'Pass'
    else:
        level = 'Fail'
    return print('Your grade of '+ str(course_code)+ ' is :' + str(final_grades)\
    +'! You get '+ level + "!" )
```
## Day 2    

*1st:To guess the number*

```
# practice while loop
# To guess the number
# code reference:
# https://github.com/cancan-huang/Python-100-Days/blob/master/Day01-15/04.%E5%BE%AA%E7%8E%AF%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84.md

import random as ran
answer = ran.randint(1,100)
times = 0

while True:
    times += 1
    guess = float(input('Plese enter the number you guess:'))
    if guess < answer:
        print('Your answer is smaller than the right answer. Try again!')
    elif guess > answer:
        print('Your answer is larger than the right answer. Try again!')
    else:
        print('You are right! You have tried '+str(times)+' times to get the right answer')
# one thing to notice is that the location of break, the break should below the else condition
# not the whole condition
        break

if times >= 10:
    print('Your chance runs out')

```

*2nd:To create the 9 Ã— 9*
```
# To create the 9*9
# below is the exercise answer:
#https://github.com/cancan-huang/Python-100-Days/blob/master/Day01-15/04.%E5%BE%AA%E7%8E%AF%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84.md

for i in range(0,10):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        results = i * j
        print(str(i),'*',str(j),'=',str(results),end = '\t')
# to separate different lines
    print()

```

*3nd:  practice print the pattern*    
```
for i in range(1,6):
    print("*" * i,end = ' ')
    print()

for i in range(1,6):
    print(' ' * (5 - i ), "*" * i, end = ' ' )
    print()

for i in range(1,6):
    print(' ' * int( ( 10 - 2 * i ) /2 ), '*' * int( 2 * i - 1 ), ' ' *  int(( 10 - 2 * i ) /2 ))
```
